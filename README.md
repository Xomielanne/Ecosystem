# Ecosystem  

This project was my course work as part of team course work - **Software and hardware platform of a managed ecosystem**

This web-service is for management software and hardware platform of a managed ecosystem.  
You can plant something there, chose way of care and don't worry about watering your plant.  
Platform will do it for you. It also can illuminate plant if you want to. Just add it to your care list.  

## Actions you can add to your way of care:
### 1. Watering  
Each watering session describes by 3 values:
1. Session start time - 00:00 - 23:00 with step of 1 hour               
2. Water volume - 50ml - 1000ml with step 50ml
3. Session frequency - 1 day - 1 month

### 2. Illumination  
Each illumination session describes by 3 values:
1. Session start time - 00:00 - 23:00 with step of 1 hour
2. Session duration - 1 hour - 23 hour with step of 1 hour
3. Session frequency - 1 day - 1 month

You can have as much both watering and illumination sessions as you want
